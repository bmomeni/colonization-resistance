Description of files included in this folder follows. 

Codes are m-files, written in Matlab
Matlab is required to run the codes
Tested in Matlab R2016b (9.1.0.441655) 64-bit (win64)

The accompanied .mat file is an example of simulation results, which can be used to produce plots similar to the figures in the manuscript. Not all .mat files are included in this folder, but they can be generated using the m-files when corresponding parameter sets are used.

NetworkConfig*.m and DistInteraction*.m are internal files for random assignment of initial interactions (see Niehaus et al, Nat. Comm. 2019 for more information).
Wellmixed*.m files are the Matlab functions that simulate an individual instance of community dynamics starting from a given initial conditions. 
AnalyzeCommunityOutcomes_*.m files analyze the results of the simulations and create the figures used in the  
ColonizationResistance*.m files simulate several instances of communities
